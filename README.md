## About BootBox

There are a lot of templates for Jekyll out there, but none of them seemed to do it for me.  I was looking for a simple template that included:
* NOT Wordpress ;)
* Bootstrasp 5
* <a href="#multi-blog-support">Multi-blog support</a>
* local assets (as much as possible...)

## Multi-Blog Support<a href="#multi-blog-support">

So what is "***Multi-Blog Support?***"  

I wanted to be able to run seperate blogs in the same domain, so that I could have public blog posts, and private ones.  I did that by seperating posts by categories, using tags to search within that category.  Within ```_config.yml```, I changed the ```permalinks``` setting to not point to a category-based folder:

```
permalink: /:categories/:year/:month/:day/:title/
```

Then used the following <a href="https://shopify.github.io/liquid/basics/introduction/">liquid</a> tag to process only posts that have thier category set to *Blog*:

```
{% if post.categories contains 'Blog' %}
```
