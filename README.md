## About BootBox

</div>

There are a lot of templates for Jekyll out there, but none of them seemed to do it for me.  I was looking for a simple template that included:
* NOT Wordpress ;)
* <a href="https://github.com/andresanz/BootBox#multi-blog-support">Multi-blog support</a>
* local assets (as much as possible...)

## Getting Started

## Multi-Blog Support<a href="https://github.com/andresanz/BootBox#multi-blog-support">

So what is "***Multi-Blog Support?***"  I wanted to be able to run seperate blogs in the same domain, so that I could have public blog posts, and private ones.  I did that by seperating posts by categories, using tags to search within that category.  Within ```_config.yml```, I changed the ```permalinks``` setting

```
permalink: /:categories/:year/:month/:day/:title/
```


### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.
* npm
```sh
npm install npm@latest -g
```

### Installation

1. Get a free API Key at [https://example.com](https://example.com)

git clone https://github.com/your_username_/Project-Name.git
```
3. Install NPM packages
